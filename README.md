# An Alaysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends to best plan a successful funding program.
Trends on previous Kickstarter campaigns for plays in GB show a success rate of %75.8 with a total of 238 successful campaigns. There is a jump of $5,505 between average goals of successful campaigns ($5,049) and failed campaigns ($10,554). Additionally, theatre-based campaigns have the highest rate of success when launched in May or June with 39 successful campaigns in May and 38 in June. Finally, Kickstarter campaigns for plays show increased rates of success with a goal of lower than $4,000, including in 4 out of 5 Edinburgh examples. Due to this, it is recommended that the budget for production be lowered closer to an amount of $2,000 for increased rates of successful funding.
